Since 1984, **Nawab Parker** has been a trusted destination for premium Indian menswear in Patna, blending timeless tradition with contemporary style. For over four decades, we have served customers looking for refined ethnic wear — from those visiting our well-known kurta pajama shop in Patna to clients across India and overseas. Our commitment to heritage-inspired design, fine fabrics, and superior craftsmanship defines every collection we create.

Our range includes kurta pajama for men, sherwanis, bandi kurtas, Indo-Western outfits, and pathani kurta pajama — each piece crafted for comfort, structure, and durability. Every garment reflects the artistry of Indian craftsmanship combined with modern tailoring, designed to suit today’s style and lifestyle.

We source only the finest materials: luxurious silk blends, premium cottons, handpicked brocades, and lightweight viscose fabrics, chosen for their breathability, finish, and feel. Distinctive embroidery, rich textures, and clean silhouettes ensure that Nawab Parker garments are both versatile and elegant.

Manufactured entirely in-house under **Surya Collection Pvt. Ltd.**, we maintain complete control over quality, sizing accuracy, and consistency — delivering standards rarely matched in the segment.

Customers seeking kurta pajama in Patna or anywhere in India can explore our collections in-store or online at [nawabparker.com](https://nawabparker.com), with styling advice, size guidance, and nationwide delivery for a truly seamless shopping experience.
